  <h1>Logo/Identity PROFILE for Matthew Roddy</h1>

  <h2>Job Title</h2>
  <p>What position are you seeking? Front-End Web Developer</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  <p>What association do you want people to have when they think of you? With thorough and well-made work, as well as strong work ethic and care for each project.</p>

  <h2>Skill Sets</h2>
  <p>What skill sets are you looking to promote? Skills with coding and design. Specifically in HTML, CSS, Javascript.</p>

  <h2>Colors</h2>
  <p>What colors are you thinking about for your “brand”?  Limit to 2 or 3 colors.  If you need more, write about the reasons. I would like the main colors I would use to be blue, white, and either a shade of grey or black. I tend to enjoy simple color schemes and this is one that is very modern, simple, and sleek which I would like my websites to be as well.</p>

  <h2>Graphics</h2>
  <p>What kind of graphics, images, shapes, or icons will help associate you with the skills, a job, or branding concept? A globe could be good to represent the inter-connectivity of the internet. A simple globe that doesn't display continents but instead has straight lines running through it could a simplified version of that. I have also considered making the frame of the logo resemble a computer monitor as that would call technology and coding to mind.</p>

  <h2>Shape Ideas</h2>
  <p>What will be the overall “background” shape of your identity mark, if any? Square, Circle, Rectangle…? Either a circle because it's a simple shape that is smooth and edgeless which implies modernity or the future. Another potential shape would be a rectangle because it resembles a computer monitor, computer tower, server stack, and other technological items.</p>
