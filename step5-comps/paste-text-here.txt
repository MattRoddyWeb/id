Quality websites, built for you and your business' future.

My name is Matt Roddy. I have a passion in Web Design and Development because I love how there is always something new to learn.I want to do everything I can to create a website to the satisfaction of my clients and their customers. I am currently pursuing an Associates in Science Degree in Multimedia Technologies, with a Concentration in Web Design and Development at Pittsburgh Technical College. This is my portfolio website which I have created to demonstrate my abilities in Front-End Web Development. It displays some of my favorite projects.I love working on various project topics and figuring out the perfect style and layout for your business. I want to develop quality experiences for website users, and provide a client with a website that meets their business goals and lives up to their standards.

Hand-coded PHP was used in this project to pull product information from a mysql database and display it on the website.

A CSS grid allows the product information to be laid out attractively and responsively. The user can click on any of the products to visit a page that retrieves detailed information about that individual product.
Dignified page styling and appealing color scheme consisting of earthy browns and greens to enhance the impression that the products are naturally made.
